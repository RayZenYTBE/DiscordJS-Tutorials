1. This commands code might only effective on this Discord.JS command handler type only. If you want to use it with your own C Handler, please use your own `module.exports` function, and copy paste **ONLY** the code below ```run: async(client, message, args) => {```. Not the entire code with the module.exports things.

# Add Commands
To add a new command, make sure you create the file with a `.js` at the end of the file's name. Create it inside the ../commands folder. Also, the command you're making, example you're making help command, you use `help.js`, the file name is the name for the command. So, make sure the command you're making is the same thing as the file's name. You cannot create a file inside another folder inside ../commands folder. It won't work.
