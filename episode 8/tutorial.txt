WARNING!!!
Before you read the tutorial, see your project already have a white page having this link => https://YourFileName.YourUserName.repl.co ? If your project did, skip step 1 - 4 on row 6 - 17 and navigate to step 5 - 9 on row 19 - 27
WARNING!!!

Tutorial :

1.) Copy every single row on index.js file and paste it on your project's index.js file. Make sure that the script that you've been pasted before having a 1 row space, or the script will be mixed up and Node JS will think that it was one piece of script. Example :

24/7 Script = require('example')
})

Your project script = require('example')

2.) Now go to Package menu (3D Box Symbol on The Right Menu) and search for discord.js and click the "+" sign to install it. If discord.js already have been installed, then skip this step.

3.) Now Run it. 

4.) If a new white page appear and saying "Its Working! Copy this link above and navigate to uptimerobot.com!", it means that your repl is working succesfully!

5.) Do what the page said! Copy the link, and go to uptimerobot.com! Do not close your project!

6.) Login/Signup on uptimerobot before you can create a monitor.

7.) Click "Create new Monitor".

8.) Choose http(s). Name it and paste the code on http(s) value. You can click the checkbox next to your E-Mail address to allow Uptime Robot send you a warning or an alert mail if one of your monitor is having Down time. Its optional anyway.

9.) Scroll down on that monitor. See it saying "No Data"? Refresh the page until it's showing "Up" with green color.
